                <p><h4>Safe Covid-19 Relief Engineering</h4></p>
                <p>Safe Covid-19 Relief Engineering (SCORE) is a non-profit organization that led by high school students. During pandimic period, I co-founded and led South Bay studernt to help fight Covid-19 througn learning, design, and 3D printing of innovative medical supplies for donation to those un urgent needs against Covid-19. After Covid-19, SCORE keep introducing Biomedical Research progrm. I used Duda framework to design and develop the website. </p>

                <h4>METALI LLC</h4>
                <p>Metali LLC is pioneer in Nanotech Metallurgy Technolgy. The company locates in Los Angeles and is leading a new metals revoulution in the 21st century. 
                This past summer, I worked with the company organizier to re-designed the layouts, typography, payment form and created mmarket materials. The website was created and developed with Wordpress.  </p>

                <h4>South Bay Rice Things</h4>
                <p>This mobile app is an UI design for a Japanese restaurant I worked at last summer called South Bay Rice Things. The restaurant mainly uses delivery services such as Grubhub and DoorDash for customers. However, I noticed that the restaurant lacked efficiency in their system of using tablets to alert the employees of online orders. Thus, I became inspired to create an app to help them.
                I used Figma to create the UI design and Photoshop to edit food images.

                <h4>Little Paws</h4>
                <p>Little Paws provides pet care after school in the South Bay of LA. Run by a group of students, the earnings go to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. To better communicate with our clients, I used Figma to design a website.<br>
                From research, ideation, and to UI design and implementation, I designed the Little Paws webpage to display pet care staff, services, rates, operation time and contact information. I also created an input form to collect schedule book info from users. I chose a card-style and grid-based layout to help users access the contents easily. The typography hierarchy highlights the important information. I chose the primary color to be a light grayish orange color. This warm, low-contrast color gently welcomes viewers into the website. I designed a little paw image in an ellipse and heart shape on Figma, then inserted it into text for a simple logo. I designed it holistically by creating branding, logos and a color scheme to attract new clients.
