          <!--
          <p>I am senior in Mira Costa High School.  I have an avid interest in the arts and media arts, and always makes an effort to learn a lot about different media arts and software tools.  My interests span 3D modeling, 2D graphic design, mobile apps
          UI design, and website design and development. </p> -->
          <p>
            I'm an artist and a prospective high school senior student from the metropolitan city of Los Angeles. Ever since I picked up a crayon when I was small, I've never stopped creating. Combining creative imagination, I am constantly exploring how to integrate art with technology, create performances and unique experiences in a variety of media and materials. My interests span virtual art,  2D graphic design, 3D modeling, mobile apps UI design, and dynamic website design and development. Whether I'm creating a picture or designing an interactive media, I'm always driven by a passion for designing efficient, effortless, and empowering experiences.  </p>

            <p>I'm excited to start my college career in the upcoming fall! When I was in Middle school, I started touring NYU. It was really impressive to see a diverse, open-minded and accepting NUY community. Interactive Media Arts is my favorite major. I learned the NYU IMA program combines liberal arts core with the ability to code, creates physical and digital interactions, and explores digital interactivity. IMA professors are pioneers in their chosen fields. They're a valuable resource for learning and motivation. A lot of department staff are professionals with diverse experiences, such as game studios owners, a curator of art exhibitions, youTuber with millions of subscribers. I really want to study at NYU in IMA and pursue a major that aligns with my interests.</p>
